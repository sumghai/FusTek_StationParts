	description = After poor sales and frequent product recalls led to the closure of the company's caravan trailers division, executives hastily rebranded these portable accomodation units as the ultimate luxury in deep space living. This version comes with flat 2.5m ends, allowing several modules of any type to be stacked together to form monolithic station modules.
