	description = Equipped with two-way full duplex K-band communications, as well as painted-on resource monitoring and waste processing systems, the Utilities Module is a must-have for every space station and/or outpost! This version comes with flat 2.5m ends, allowing several modules of any type to be stacked together to form monolithic station modules.
