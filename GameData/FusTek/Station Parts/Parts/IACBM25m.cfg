	description = An innovative new docking/berthing solution, the Improved Androgynous Common Berthing Mechanism (IACBM) features integrated LED illumination units and in-flight toggle between Active/Passive guide fin configurations. This 2.5 m diameter variant is designed for large spacecraft or in-orbit mating of interplanetary transfer stages to payloads, and can optionally be retrofitted with a (decorative) hatch on a non-FusTek crew compartment/pod.
