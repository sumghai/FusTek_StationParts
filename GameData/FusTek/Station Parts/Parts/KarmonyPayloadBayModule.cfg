	description = After receiving hundreds of crayon-scrawled letters addressing certain issues, company management conceded and decided to offer a Warehouse module variant without the annoying rotary FLEXrack magazine. This version comes with flat 2.5m ends, allowing several modules of any type to be stacked together to form monolithic station modules.
