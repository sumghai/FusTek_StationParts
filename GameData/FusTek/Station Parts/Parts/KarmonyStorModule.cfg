	description = Originally designed as stage sets for shooting corridor scenes in high-budget science fiction blockbusters such as "3001: Jeb's Odyssey", an engineering intern discovered that one could, um, actually fit lockers in there for storing packed lunches and spare self-sealing stem bolts. This version comes with flat 2.5m ends, allowing several modules of any type to be stacked together to form monolithic station modules.
